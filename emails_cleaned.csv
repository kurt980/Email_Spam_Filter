Join Medium.Dear Medium member,We asked and you delivered. You suggested essays for our Women’s History Month list. You told us your pandemic stories. You applied to our Verified Author program.To that end, we’ve been including your work in our “Staff Picks” story list celebrating remarkable women for Women’s History Month. These pieces are essential, and eye-opening; please keep them coming. I’d also like to resurface a series that recognized one historically-overlooked group of women: Black authors. The Zora Canon was a first-of-its-kind collection of the greatest books written by African American women, assembled in collaboration with a blue-ribbon panel of authorities on women’s literature. Published three years ago, it continues to resonate with readers.Devon Price’s journey to authorship via Medium resonates as well. Price snagged a book deal after his 2018 piece, “Laziness Does Not Exist,” went viral. You can find Price’s story on Medium’s official blog, where we talked to him about his ideas. We’ll be highlighting other authors whose work has intersected with Medium over the coming months.One more: Ahead of the third anniversary of the COVID-19 epidemic, we asked Medium writers to share their pandemic stories. Nearly 600 of you responded, writing on topics ranging from the personal to the medical to the political. You can read a list of some of our favorites, or see the full range of #Pandemic Stories here (and if you’d like to share yours, just add that tag to it when you hit publish, and we’ll keep an eye out).Lastly, a note for the writers among you: We’ve just upgraded the experience of publishing to Medium on our mobile apps. To see the changes, make sure you’ve updated to the most recent version of the Medium app, and read more here.As always, thank you for reading.Scott LambVP, Content @ MediumHandpicked stories from our editorial team[Image ""1*GqpC3jSG7D4dJluH0vWlHA.png""]ANNA IURCHENKODesigner at Google Health Discovering Creativity: On Your Unique Blob and the Threat of NormalcyA reflection of my journey in finding my creative self and an attempt to understand why and how creative identity can be hidden Read more[Image ""1*T6ExYAwqxEgnjfN1wEHh5g.png""]GIOVANNI MALLOYData and decision scientist College Basketball’s NET Rankings, ExplainedHow data science drives March Madness Read more[Image ""1*nSb8Zf0vK0qYXuYgzDAUwg.png""]SCOTT H.

The “Great Boom” was supposed to last.From 1870-1970, there was an incredible 50x increase in the productivity of the average manual worker. Let me break that down so it really lands for you like it did for me:- 50x Increase: Imagine getting 50 hours of work done in one hour. Or imagine doing the work of 50 people by yourself.- On Average: We’re not just talking about a 50x increase for the most ambitious, smartest manual workers. We’re talking about all manual workers.To put the profundity in context, the “Great Boom” is one of the most amazing and under-appreciated events in economic history. The chart below captures its magnitude and uniqueness:[Image ""Weekend+Read+chart.png""] To more deeply appreciate this shift, consider the following:- This is a unique event in all of history. “Modern humans first emerged about 100,000 years ago. For the next 99,800 years or so, nothing happened…Then — just a couple of hundred years ago — people started getting richer. And richer and richer still,” states Economist Steven Landsburg.- Before it happened, the average American lived on about a dollar a day (in today’s dollars). “Before 1750, almost nowhere in the world were living standards something that we would call anything but miserable and poor,” according to economic historian Joel Mokyr. Economist Steven Landsburg adds, “Almost everyone lived on the modern equivalent of $400 to $600 a year, just above the subsistence level.”- Before it happened, day-to-day life was brutal. “In 1870, farm and urban working-class family members [in the United States] bathed in a large tub in the kitchen, often the only heated room in the home, after carrying cold water in pails from the outside and warming it over the open-hearth fireplace,” according to economic historian Robert Gordon.Bottom line: The people alive between 1870–1970 experienced unprecedented change. Now, imagine being an adult in 1970. Think about how you’d see the world…Unlock the full story — plus millions more — when you become a Medium member for less than $1/week.Join Medium html"
